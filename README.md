# Fractal Rendering App
Interactive app for visualization of Mandelbrot and Julia sets written in Python and GLSL.  

![main_app.py](docs/main_app.gif)


## Features

* GPU-accelerated rendering via OpenGL 4.0.
* Double precision arithmetic with zoom up to 10^15.
* Interactive panning and zooming with the mouse.
* Interactive switching between Mandelbrot and Julia sets.
* Arbitrary window resizing, full-screen and vsync support.
* Automatic DPI-scaling and variable render size.
* Fully customizable configuration file.
* 296 available colormaps.


## Usage

### How to run the app in Python?

The app is tested and works on Windows 11 and Linux Debian 11. It should also work on MacOS systems that still
support OpenGL. 

Please make sure you have installed the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) before continuing. Furthermore, it is advisable
to use python and install modules inside a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). Copy the 
following commands into the terminal:   

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh  
   git clone git@github.com:MarkoLeskovar/FractalRendering.git 
   cd FractalRendering/
   ```

2. Install required the python modules from [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt):  
   ```sh  
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
3. Run the main script to run the interactive app:
   ```sh  
   python main_app.py
   ```

If you are experiencing low FPS while running the app on a laptop with both integrated and dedicated GPUs, make sure to 
enable the dedicated GPU in your
[Nvidia Control Panel](https://www.nvidia.com/content/Control-Panel-Help/vLatest/en-us/mergedProjects/nv3d/Setting_the_Preferred_Graphics_Processor.htm) 
or [AMD Radeon](https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/faq/dh2-024) software.


### How to create executable app?

The app can also be used without installing a Python interpreter or any module. This is achieved thought the use of 
[Pyinstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/). You can create the executable file yourself by running the 
[`main_install.py`](install/main_install.py) or simply download the 
pre-build package from the link bellow:   

* [FractalRenderingApp.zip](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fractalrendering/files/) 
for Windows 10/11 x64.


## Controls & Customization

Fully customizable list of all available app settings and controls is available in the [`config.json`](fractals/assets/config.json) file. Bellow
you will find some of the most used keys.

* Use `ARROW KEY UP` / `DOWN` or `MOUSE SCROLL` to zoom in and out.
* Use `ARROW KEY LEFT` / `RIGHT` to change colormaps.
* Use `+` / `-` to increase or decrease the number of fractal iterations.
* Use `*` / `/` to increase or decrease the pixel scaling.
* Use `J` to switch between fractal rendering modes.
* Use `I` to switch between info text modes.
* Use `R` to reset pan and zoom.
* Use `S` to take a screenshot.
* Use `F` to toggle fullscreen.
* Use `V` to toggle vsync.
